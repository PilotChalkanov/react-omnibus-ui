## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 14)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the project for production.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint for code quality checks.
- `npm run server`: Locally serve the production build.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains source code, including components, features, and configurations.
- **public/**: Static assets served by the project.
- **dist/**: Distribution folder for production builds.
- **node_modules/**: External dependencies.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Tailwind CSS configuration file.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration for Vite.

## Configuration

- **Tailwind CSS**: Configured with the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- **ESLint**: Configured for code quality and standards in `.eslintrc.json`.
- **PostCSS**: Additional configuration in `postcss.config.js`.

## Contribution

Please follow these guidelines if you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.

Ensure that your code follows the existing style and that you've run `npm run lint` before submitting.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool for code quality.
- **PostCSS**: Tool for transforming CSS.

## Known Issues & Improvements

### Improvements:

1. **State Management**: Consider adopting modern state management libraries like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
2. **Type Safety**: Introduce TypeScript for enhanced code safety.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement global error boundaries in React.
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for critical components and services.
5. **Performance**: Introduce lazy loading for large components to optimize performance.

### Issues:

- No comprehensive testing strategy is currently in place.
- Potential performance bottlenecks in large page components.
